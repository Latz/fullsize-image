# Fullsize Image - makes images fit to the Chrome viewport

Fullheight Image plugin makes images _automatically_ fit to the Chrome viewport, either maximum width or height, while maintaining the aspect ratio.
The automatic resizing can be disabled by clicking the extension's icon. Not more, not less.

## Installation

Go to the Chrome web store and click "Add to Chrome": https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/fullsize-image/ocgclkfelcogdijknegaepbcgkbmbcib
